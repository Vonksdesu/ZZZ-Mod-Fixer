# ZZZ-Mod-Fixer (Community Update)

This is a Python-based tool designed to update and fix character skin mod hash IBs for the game **Zenless Zone Zero (ZZZ)** to ensure compatibility with the latest versions of the game.

## About The Project

This project is a community-driven continuation of the original **ZZZ-Mod-Fixer** tool. 

Since the original creator has not released any new updates, I have taken the initiative to update the program independently to support Zenless Zone Zero versions **2.6 to 2.8**. 

### Key Improvements in This Version:
* **Updated Hash Database**: Added support for newer character hashes (v2.6 – v2.8).
* **Backup File Conflict Fix**: In the original version, updated `.ini` mod files often conflicted with the backup (original) `.ini` files when left in the same folder. I have modified the code to automatically move the old/backup `.ini` files to a separate folder, preventing any conflicts and keeping your mod directory clean.

*Note: This tool is exclusively designed to fix and update character skin mods. It is not intended for other types of mods.*

## How to Use

1. **Download**: Download the latest `zzz-mod-fixer-v2.8.exe` from the [Releases](../../releases) page.
2. **Placement**: Place the `.exe` file **directly** inside the `Mods` folder within your **XXMI Launcher** installation directory. 
   > ⚠️ **Important:** Do *not* create a new folder for the `.exe` inside the `Mods` folder, as the program may not work properly.
3. **Run**: Run the program and wait for the process to complete.
4. **Launch**: Once the process is finished, open your **XXMI Launcher** and launch *Zenless Zone Zero*.

### ⚠️ Notice for Users of the Original ZZZ-Mod-Fixer

If you have previously processed your mods using **Petrascyll's original tool**, you may experience conflicts due to left-over backup files that cause the mods to fail to load. 

To resolve this, please choose one of the two options below:

#### **Option 1: Quick Cleanup (Manual)**
Use this option if you want to keep your current mod setup:
1. Open your mod folder(s).
2. Manually find and **delete** all old backup `.ini` files that start with `DISABLED_BACKUP_` (e.g., `DISABLED_BACKUP_1.ini`).
3. Run the game via **XXMI Launcher**.

#### **Option 2: Clean Setup (Highly Recommended)**
This is the most recommended method to prevent any hidden conflicts and ensure the best results:
1. **Delete all mod folders** inside your main `Mods` directory.
2. Replace them with **fresh, untouched mod files** (use backups that have *never* been modified or processed by Petrascyll's original program).
3. Place and run my `zzz-mod-fixer-v2.8.exe` inside the `Mods` folder to automatically update them.
4. Launch the game via **XXMI Launcher**.

## Disclaimer

This project is not my own original creation from scratch; I am simply maintaining and updating it of my own volition to keep the tool working for the community. 

As this is my first time maintaining a project like this and I am working on it solo, there may still be bugs or edge cases where some mods cannot be fully repaired. I apologize for any inconvenience, and I highly appreciate your understanding and support!
